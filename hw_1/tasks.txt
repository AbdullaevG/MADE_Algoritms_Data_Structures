1. Very Simple Sort

You are given a small array of integers. Your task is to sort it in non-decreasing order.

--Input--
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 1_000) — the number of elements in the array.
 The second line contains n integers which do not exceed 10**9 by absolute value.

--Output--
The sole line of the output should contain the same array but in the non-decreasing order.
The elements should be separated by space.



2. Simple sort

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to sort them in non-decreasing order.

--Input--
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 100_000) — the number of elements
in the array. The second line contains n integers which do not exceed 10**9 by absolute value.

--Output--
The sole line of the output should contain the same array but in the non-decreasing order.
The elements should be separated by space.



3. Number of inversions

Given an array A=⟨a1,a2,…,an⟩ of distinct integers. You have to find the number of pairs of
indices (i,j) such that i<j and a_i>a_j.

--Input--
The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500_000) — number of elements in array A.
The second line contains the elements of the array a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10**6) separated by space.
No two elements of the array coincide.

--Output--
Output one integer — the number of inversions in the given array.



4. Simple sort

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to sort them in non-decreasing order.

--Input--
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 100_000) — the number of
elements in the array. The second line contains n integers which do not exceed 10**9 by absolute value.

--Output--
The sole line of the output should contain the same array but in the non-decreasing order.
The elements should be separated by space.
